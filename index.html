                    Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform
                    aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through
                    proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2] and sufficient rest along with a formal
                    recovery plan.[3]

                    Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's
                    activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles,
                    physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and
                    effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, improve
                    immune system and to meet emergency situations.[4]

                Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just
                that, promoting functional movement while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.


                Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.
                Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your
                thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.
                Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is
                one rep.
                Complete 3 sets of 10 reps.

                <p>
                    The push-up (sometimes called a press-up in British English) is a common calisthenics exercise
                    beginning from the prone position. By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups
                    exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest
                    of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole.[1] Push-ups are
                    a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military
                    physical training. They are also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, and
                    some martial arts disciplines.

                <p class="para">
                    A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and
                    then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle
                    joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when
                    standing up.

                    Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body
                    muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are
                    the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.[1] The squat also
                    isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.

                    The plank (also called a front hold, hover, or abdominal bridge) is an isometric core strength
                    exercise that involves maintaining a position similar to a push-up for the maximum possible time.
                    The most common plank is the forearm plank which is held in a push-up-like position, with the body's
                    weight borne on forearms, elbows, and toes. Many variations exist such as the side plank and the
                    reverse plank.[1][2] The plank is commonly practiced in Pilates and yoga, and by those training for
                    boxing and other sports.

                    A pull-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The pull-up is a closed-chain movement where the body
                    is suspended by the hands and pulls up. As this happens, the elbows flex and the shoulders adduct
                    and extend to bring the elbows to the torso.

                    Pull-ups use many different muscles of the upper body, including the latissimus dorsi and the biceps
                    brachii.[1] A pull-up may be performed with overhand (pronated), underhand (supinated), neutral,
                    mixed, or rotating hand position. The term chin-up is sometimes used to refer to the pull-up
                    performed with supinated grip.

                    Pull-ups are used by some organizations as a component of fitness tests.

            Eating foods high in fat, sugar and refined carbohydrates (most of which are empty calories) can affect your exercise performance by draining your energy, impairing your metabolism, contributing to weight gain and raising your risk of other chronic diseases.

            </b><br>
                By now, it's pretty clear that the effects of fast food on your mind and body can be quite damaging. A diet of chronic fast food consumption comes with a slew of harmful health effects, ranging from an increased risk of heart disease to diabetes and obesity.

The obvious result of eating a diet filled with fast food cheeseburgers, fries, processed meats, salty snacks and sugary sweets like donuts is the higher risk of putting on pounds. It's often the first thing people notice when they're eating unhealthy, but it's not the only thing that happens to your body.

In fact, a lot of the effects of fast food are invisible until it's too late. Fast food increases belly fat, which is linked to chronic problems like inflammation and high blood pressure, according to the Mayo Clinic.

            To avoid the negative health risks to your, your diet needs to be nutritional and diverse. Small changes to your diet can make an immense difference to your health. It’s easier than you think, especially if you follow at least six of the eight goals outlined below. <br><br>
            <b>
            1.Make half your plate fruits and vegetables:</b> The more colourful you plate, the more likely you are to get the vitamins, minerals and fibre your body needs, so be sure to choose a variety of red, orange and green vegetables (such as tomatoes, sweet potatoes and broccoli).<br><br>
            <b>
            2.Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk:</b> Fat free and low fat milk contains the same amount of calcium and other nutrients as whole milk, but contains fewer calories and less saturated fat.<br><br>
             <b>
            3.Choose a variety of lean protein foods:</b> Lean meats (meat with lower fat content) are far better than meat with large amounts of fat content. Select leaner cuts of beef, turkey breast of chicken breast.<br><br>
            <b>
            4.Compare sodium in foods:</b> Use the nutritional facts included in the labels on food packaging to select foods containing low levels of sodium. Choose canned foods with labels stating low sodium, reduced sodium or no salt added. <br><br>
             <b>
            5.Drink water instead of sugary drinks:</b> By drinking water or unsweetened, you can cut your calories substantially. Sodas and energy drinks are high in added sugar and calories, so be sure to avoid these. If you seek added flavor, try adding a slice of lemon, lime or watermelon to your glass of water.<br><br>
            <b>
            6.Eat some seafood:</b> Seafood such as fish and shellfish are high in protein, minerals and omega-3 fatty acids (healthy fat). Try eating at least eight ounces of seafood a week if you are an adult.<br><br>
            <b>
            7.Cut back on solid fats:</b> Major sources of solid fats are cakes, cookies, ice cream and processed meat. Try to avoid these to cut back on your solid fat intake.
